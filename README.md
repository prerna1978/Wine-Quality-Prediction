# Wine-Quality-Prediction
üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction Using Random Forest
Developed a classification model using Random Forest Classifier to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, pH, alcohol). Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix) to optimize performance.

Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Keywords: Random Forest, classification, wine quality, data preprocessing, model evaluation, ensemble learning
